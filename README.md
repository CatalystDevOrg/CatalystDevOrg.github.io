# get-catalyst
The website for the Catalyst browser
## Getting started with development
For this project, I'm using the `pnpm` package manager. So, if you haven't got it already, [install it](https://pnpm.io/installation) and then run `pnpm install`.
Then you can `pnpm run dev` to start the development server for the site.
